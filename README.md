# ML-Policy-PoW

Proof of Work (PoW) based cyberdefense systems
require incoming network requests to expend effort solving
an arbitrary mathematical puzzle. Current state of the art is
unable to differentiate between trustworthy and untrustworthy
connections, requiring all to solve complex puzzles. In this
paper, we introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted PoW
framework that utilizes IP traffic based features to inform an
‘adaptive’ issuer which can then generate puzzles with varying
hardness. The modular framework uses these capabilities to
ensure that untrustworthy clients solve harder puzzles thereby
incurring longer latency than authentic requests to receive a
response from the server. Our preliminary findings reveal our
approach effectively throttles untrustworthy traffic.

This repository contains code related to our work A Policy Driven AI-Assisted PoW Framework. This is a published work The 52nd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks.
